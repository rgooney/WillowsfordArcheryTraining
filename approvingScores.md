# Willowsford Approving Scores Doc
## Getting Scores Approved

1. All scoring forms must be approved by an officer, before submitting the scoring form through the **Scoring Application**.
2. Officers will need to check the form and verify that ONLY scores of 0-5 have been entered within the form. Scores of X will be noted within **Notes**.
3. Scores can only be between 0-5, and if an X is scored, it needs to be marked in the **Notes** section of the application.
4. There may be empty fields left unfilled, to which the application will default to a value of 0. This will be factored into the **Round Score**, **Cumulative Score**, and **Total Score**.
5. Once scores have been entered, and an officer has approved the form, it may then be submitted.
